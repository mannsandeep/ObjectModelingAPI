# ObjectModelingAP
Purpose: To showcase, Why type based composition is important for domain or API based architecture. If we tie our implementation with class based contract then scalability can not be achieved in a proper way. 

Define a class 'Consumer' which Compose(has-a) another object e.g. 'Account'. 'Account' Object show's balance( method showBalance()). 
Object of 'Account' is implemented through interface contract rather tied with class based contract.
